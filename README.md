# COVID-19 Analysis Notebook
**By Duncan McGough**

*Julia data science notebook for COVID-19 investigation*
---
*Data from: [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)*

This notebook tracks COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths for US states. Change the `path` variable to the cloned directory of the Hopkins repository above, `states` vector to desired states to investigate, and add any population totals to `pop_dict` for the respective states. I created this notebook to practice Julia and data science on a practical real-world example.
